# Artist-Favouritism

i have too many songs on spotify and add them into too many playlists... but maybe one day i only feel like listening to twenty one pilots but oh no!!! i do not remember which of my playlists i've added their tracks to!!! Well yup this pretty much sums up the motivation for this script.

## What this simple app uses:
- Spotipy wrapper
- OAuth2 for user authentication
- my blood sweat and tears

<h2>What does it do, basically?</h2>
Goes through all my user-owned playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist. Compiles them into a new playlist ðŸ’œ


### Additional Notes: 
- removing access from this app via your Spotify account will break it, because I didn't bother to handle that. i think you would have to redo the authorization process.
- my code is noob cos i am noob. but as long as it works then it works yknow?
- I made this because this was a huge problem I faced believe it or not lmao
