# Artist-Favouritism

i have too many songs on Spotify and add them into too many playlists... but maybe one day i only feel like listening to twenty one pilots but oh no i do not remember which of my playlists i've added their tracks to. Well yup this pretty much sums up the motivation for this script.

## What this simple app uses:
- Spotipy wrapper
- OAuth2 for user authentication
- my blood sweat and tears

<h2>What does it do, basically?</h2>
Goes through all my user-owned playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist. Compiles them into a new playlist ðŸ’œ


### Additional Notes: 
- removing access from this app via your Spotify account WILL break it, because I didn't bother to handle that. i think you would have to create a whole new app and redo the authorization process.
- some parts of my code might not seem vErY PyThoNic because i noob so go easy on me :')
- I made this because this was a huge problem I faced believe it or not HAHAHA
