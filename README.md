# Artist-Favouritism
For when I have the urge to listen to all the songs i like from a specific artist, which i've added to different playlists.

<h2>What it does</h2>
Goes through all my created playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist. Compiles them into a new playlist (which I will proceed to delete soon enough when I am sick of it.)


### Additional Notes: 
- check instructions.txt on how to run
- my code is quite trash i think. but as long as it works then it works yknow
- I made this because this was actually a huge problem I faced believe it or not...
