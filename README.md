# Artist-Favouritism
For when I have the urge to listen to only the songs I like from a specific artist.

## What it does
Goes through all my created playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist.  
Compiles them into a new playlist (which I will proceed to delete after i get sick of loooping it lol!)


## How to run locally:
1. Navigate to root directory
2. Run the script (artist_favouritism.py) with python
3. Follow instructions on script


## Troubleshooting:
If refresh token has been revoked:
1. Remove app from your spotify account
2. Delete .cache file (hidden file on mac, use shift+cmd+. to unhide)
3. Re-run artist_favouritism.py


## Authors' Notes:
- my code is quite trash honestly. but as long as it works then it works ;)
- I made this mainly for my own problem haha. But have since sent this script to a few friends who saw it and saw the use-cases for it too. happy to share!
- might make a UI for it some day when i'm free
