# Artist-Favouritism
For when I have the urge to listen to all the songs i like from a specific artist, which i've added to different playlists.

<h2>What it does</h2>
Goes through all my created playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist. Compiles them into a new playlist (which I will proceed to delete soon enough when I am sick of it.)


## How to run locally:
1. Navigate to root directory
2. Run the script (artist_favouritism.py) with python
3. Follow instructions on script

### Additional Notes: 
- my code is quite trash i think. but as long as it works then it works yknow
- I made this because this was actually a huge problem I faced believe it or not...

## Troubleshooting:
If refresh token has been revoked:
- Remove app from your spotify account
- Delete .cache file (hidden file on mac, use shift+cmd+. to unhide)
- Re-run artist_favouritism.py
