# Artist-Favouritism

i have too many songs on spotify and add them into too many playlists... so if one day I just feel like listening to all the songs i like from a single artist, i can't do that lol. therefore i made this app because i'm problematic.

<h2>What it does</h2>
Goes through all my user-owned playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist. Compiles them into a new playlist which I will proceed to delete soon enough when I am sick of it.


### Additional Notes: 
- removing access from this app via your Spotify account will break it, because I didn't bother to handle that. i think you would have to redo the authorization process.
- my code is quite trash i think. but as long as it works then it works yknow
- I made this because this was a huge problem I faced believe it or not...
