# Artist-Favouritism

i have too many songs on spotify and add them into too many playlists... and if one day I just feel like listening to all the songs i like from one (1) artist, i can't do that !!! therefore i made this app. purely for me and my own dumb problems.

## What I made this app with:
- pure python 
- Spotipy wrapper (python wrapper for Spotify web API)
- OAuth2 
- my blood sweat and tears

<h2>What does it do, basically?</h2>
Goes through all my user-owned playlists and picks out the tracks by the specified artist. Compiles them into a new playlist ðŸ’œ


### Additional Notes: 
- removing access from this app via your Spotify account will break it, because I didn't bother to handle that. i think you would have to redo the authorization process.
- my code is noob cos i am noob. but as long as it works then it works yknow?
- I made this because this was a huge problem I faced believe it or not lmao
